# Face-Recognition-Using-Wavelet-Transform-and-SVM-Classifier
This project involves developing an advanced face recognition system using wavelet transform and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It includes image preprocessing, feature extraction with wavelet transforms, and classification using SVM, leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyWavelets, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
